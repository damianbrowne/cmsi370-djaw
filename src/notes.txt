DAMIAN's NOTES:
*some things to consider as we iterate
*some of these can be seen as to-do items

- darken the colors (especially the light blue color) to create more 
contrast with the white background

- find ways to add more colors in general (to make it more inviting for kids!)

- consider new name (more descriptive, kid-friendly?). maybe:
    - PT 4 kids
    - Monkey PT
    - tagline: Monkey See, Monkey do

- new logo
    - i personally really like the monkey mascot, so we could do some research
    and sketching on that

- we should think about how the home page menu and hamburger menu differentiate
and what we should use each for

- add currency count somewhere (bananas)

- add overall progress to Home page

- maybe we should call the classes page "Exercises" ?

- I thought we were just doing videos for this version and not live classes

- Non-design related: I will talk to my mother asap about survey questions and video ideas.
    - maybe we want to make a video or two (I could do it) for the website as an example

- ability to view who is logged in in the header
